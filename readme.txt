== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I configure the plugin settings? =

Use the *WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Victoriabank* screen to configure the plugin.

= Where can I get the Merchant Data and Connection Settings? =

The merchant data and connection settings are provided by Victoriabank. This data is used by the plugin to connect to the Victoriabank payment gateway and process the card transactions. Please see [https://www.victoriabank.md/en/carduri-pj/e-commerce](https://www.victoriabank.md/en/carduri-pj/e-commerce) and contact [Card.Acceptare@vb.md](mailto:Card.Acceptare@vb.md) for details.

= What store settings are supported? =

Victoriabank currently supports transactions in MDL (Moldovan Leu), EUR (Euro) and USD (United States Dollar).

= What is the difference between transaction types? =

* **Charge** submits all transactions for settlement.
* **Authorization** simply authorizes the order total for capture later. Use the *Complete transaction* order action to settle the previously authorized transaction.

= Why the last four digits of the card number are not received from the bank? =

Make sure Victoriabank has properly set up the *Callback URL* in the payment gateway terminal settings. See [Installation Instructions](./installation/) for more details.

To verify the exact response data received from the bank payment gateway - enable *Debug mode* logging in the plugin settings.

= How can I manually process a bank transaction response callback data message received by email from the bank? =

As part of the backup procedure Victoriabank payment gateway sends a duplicate copy of the transaction responses to a specially designated merchant email address specified during initial setup.
If the automated response payment notification callback failed the shop administrator can manually process the transaction response message received from the bank.
Go to the payment gateway settings screen *Payment Notification* section and click *Advanced*, paste the bank transaction response data as received in the email and click *Process*.
