= How can I configure the plugin settings? =

Use the *WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > Victoriabank* screen to configure the plugin.

= Where can I get the Merchant Data and Connection Settings? =

The merchant data and connection settings are provided by Victoriabank. This data is used by the plugin to connect to the Victoriabank payment gateway and process the card transactions. Please see [www.victoriabank.md](https://www.victoriabank.md) and contact [Card.Acceptare@vb.md](mailto:Card.Acceptare@vb.md) for details.

= What store settings are supported? =

Victoriabank currently supports transactions in MDL (Moldovan Leu).

* **Charge** submits all transactions for settlement.
* **Authorization** simply authorizes the order total for capture later. Use the *Complete transaction* order action to settle the previously authorized transaction.
